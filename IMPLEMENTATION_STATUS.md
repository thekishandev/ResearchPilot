### 2. ❌ Automated Fact-Checking
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Requirements:** Cross-source verification logic, claim extraction  
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours  
**Demo Impact:** HIGH

### 3. ❌ Research Template Library
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Requirements:** Template system (SWOT, competitive analysis, etc.)  
**Estimated Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Demo Impact:** MEDIUM

### 4. ❌ Browser Extension
**Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Requirements:** Chrome/Firefox extension development  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours (out of scope)  
**Demo Impact:** HIGH (but time-prohibitive)

### 5. ❌ API for Integration
**Status:** PARTIALLY AVAILABLE  
**Note:** FastAPI backend already provides RESTful API  
**Next Steps:** API documentation, authentication, rate limiting  
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

## 🎯 PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR REMAINING TIME

### High Priority (Next 30-60 minutes)

1. **Multi-turn Conversation Threading** (45 min)
   - Link follow-ups to parent queries
   - Show conversation tree in history
   - High demo impact

2. **Voice Query Input** (30 min)
   - Add microphone button
   - Web Speech API integration
   - Wow factor for live demo

3. **API Documentation** (20 min)
   - Auto-generated Swagger docs (already available at `/docs`)
   - Add README section on API usage
   - Low effort, shows completeness

### Medium Priority (If time allows)

4. **Custom Source Configuration UI** (1 hour)
   - Toggle sources on/off
   - Demonstrates flexibility
   
5. **Research Template Library** (1.5 hours)
   - Pre-built query templates
   - Shows vertical-specific use cases

### Low Priority (Nice to have)

6. **Automated Fact-Checking** (2 hours)

1. ✅ Show homepage with sponsor badges (Cerebras, Llama, Docker)
2. ✅ Click sample query or type custom query
3. ✅ Watch live orchestration (6 sources querying in parallel)
4. ✅ See streaming synthesis in real-time
5. ✅ Point out credibility scores on each source
6. ✅ Click "Ask Follow-up Question" to show multi-turn capability
7. ✅ Show research history sidebar
8. ✅ Export report to Markdown
9. ✅ Show gateway health check: `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
10. ✅ Show metrics: `curl http://localhost:8080/metrics`

**All 10 steps are READY TO DEMO!**

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT & KNOWN ISSUES

1. ⚠️ Credibility scores are currently mocked (not using Ollama for real scoring)
2. ⚠️ Research history doesn't show created_at timestamps in UI
3. ⚠️ No pagination on research history (fixed at 10 items)
4. ⚠️ Follow-up queries aren't threaded in database
5. ⚠️ No user authentication (all queries are anonymous)

**None of these block the demo** - they're post-hackathon improvements.

---

## 📝 NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION

**Option A: Polish existing features (Low Risk)**
- Add timestamps to research history
- Improve error messages
- Add loading skeletons
- **Time: 30 minutes, Safe choice**

**Option B: Add Voice Input (Medium Risk, High Impact)**
- Implement Web Speech API
- Add microphone button
- **Time: 30 minutes, Wow factor**

**Option C: Add Multi-turn Threading (Medium Risk, Medium Impact)**
- Link follow-ups to parent queries
- Show conversation tree
- **Time: 45 minutes, Shows depth**

**My Recommendation: Option B (Voice Input)**
- Quick to implement
- High demo impact
- Differentiates from competitors
- Aligns with "conversational AI" narrative

---

**Summary:** We've implemented **55% of all planned features**, with **100% of MUST HAVE and QUICK WINS complete**. The system is fully functional and demo-ready. Remaining time should focus on high-impact, low-risk enhancements like voice input or polishing existing features.
