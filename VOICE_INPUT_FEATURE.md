# 🎙️ VOICE INPUT FEATURE - Wow Factor Demo Enhancement

**Implemented Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Feature:** Voice-to-text research queries using Web Speech API

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

**What:** Speak your research queries instead of typing them  
**Why:** High demo impact, accessibility, modern UX  
**How:** Web Speech API (built into Chrome, Edge, Safari)

---

## ✅ Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Web Speech API** - Browser-native speech recognition
- **Browser Support:**
  - ✅ Chrome/Chromium (full support)
  - ✅ Edge (full support)
  - ✅ Safari (iOS/macOS support)
  - ❌ Firefox (not supported yet)

### Code Changes

**File:** `frontend/src/components/ResearchInterface.tsx`

#### 1. State Management
```typescript
const [isListening, setIsListening] = useState(false)
const [recognition, setRecognition] = useState<any>(null)
```

#### 2. Initialize Speech Recognition
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if ('webkitSpeechRecognition' in window || 'SpeechRecognition' in window) {
    const SpeechRecognition = (window as any).webkitSpeechRecognition || (window as any).SpeechRecognition
    const recognitionInstance = new SpeechRecognition()
    recognitionInstance.continuous = false
    recognitionInstance.interimResults = false
    recognitionInstance.lang = 'en-US'

    recognitionInstance.onresult = (event: any) => {
      const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript
      setQuery(transcript)
      setIsListening(false)
    }

    recognitionInstance.onerror = (event: any) => {
      console.error('Speech recognition error:', event.error)
      setIsListening(false)
    }

    recognitionInstance.onend = () => {
      setIsListening(false)
    }

    setRecognition(recognitionInstance)
  }
}, [])
```

#### 3. Toggle Voice Input Function
```typescript
const toggleVoiceInput = () => {
  if (!recognition) {
    alert('Voice input is not supported in your browser. Please use Chrome, Edge, or Safari.')
    return
  }

  if (isListening) {
    recognition.stop()
    setIsListening(false)
  } else {
    recognition.start()
    setIsListening(true)
  }
}
```

#### 4. Voice Input Button UI
```tsx
<div className="relative">
  <Textarea
    placeholder="Example: What are the latest breakthroughs in quantum computing?"
    value={query}
    onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
    className="min-h-[120px] resize-none pr-14"
    disabled={isLoading}
  />
  {/* Voice Input Button */}
  <Button
    type="button"
    variant="ghost"
    size="sm"
    onClick={toggleVoiceInput}
    disabled={isLoading || !recognition}
    className={`absolute bottom-3 right-3 h-8 w-8 p-0 ${
      isListening ? 'text-red-500 animate-pulse' : 'text-muted-foreground hover:text-primary'
    }`}
    title={isListening ? 'Stop listening' : 'Start voice input'}
  >
    {isListening ? (
      <MicOff className="h-4 w-4" />
    ) : (
      <Mic className="h-4 w-4" />
    )}
  </Button>
</div>
```
