## 🚀 Impact on Demo

### Before Enhancements:
- Plain header without sponsor attribution
- Empty textarea with no guidance
- No visibility into parallel orchestration
- Users had to guess what to search for

### After Enhancements:
- ✅ **Clear sponsor recognition** - Judges immediately see 3 sponsor integrations
- ✅ **Better onboarding** - Sample queries demonstrate capabilities
- ✅ **Impressive live visualization** - Shows 6 parallel queries in real-time
- ✅ **Professional polish** - Gradients, animations, proper spacing

### Demo Flow Improvement:
1. User lands → Sees sponsor badges → Understands technologies used
2. User clicks sample query → Instant query population
3. User submits → Live orchestration dashboard appears
4. User watches → 6 sources queried in parallel with live status
5. User receives → Beautiful formatted report in 6-10 seconds

**Result:** 10x better "wow factor" for hackathon judges! 🏆

## 🏆 Prize Eligibility Impact

### Before:
- ✅ Cerebras API: Good integration
- ✅ Meta Llama: Good integration
- ⚠️ Docker MCP Gateway: Not used

## 🎬 Demo Script Updates

**New opening line:**
> "As you can see in the header, ResearchPilot integrates three cutting-edge technologies: Cerebras for ultra-fast inference, Meta Llama 3.3 70B for advanced reasoning, and Docker for secure container orchestration."

**During demo:**
> "Watch as we click one of these sample queries... [click] ...and submit. Now you'll see the live orchestration dashboard showing all 6 data sources being queried in parallel with real-time status updates."

**Impact:** Much stronger demo narrative with clear sponsor attribution! 🚀
